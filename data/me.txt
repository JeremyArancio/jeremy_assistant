After more than 5 years as a research engineer in France, I decided to take full control of my life.
I decided in October 2021 to leave everything to start my entrepreneurial activity, learn Data Science from scratch, and work with companies around the world.
I document my adventure on social media. I tell my story and experience through podcasts and conferences.
I see life as an epic adventure, where I am the hero of my own story, seeking to gain experience points in the range of skills that characterize me.


Concerning my education, I have done all my studies in France. After succeeding preparatory classes for the French "Grandes Ecoles", I got an engineer degree at ENSEM (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d'Electricit√© et de M√©canique) in 2016. I also got a PhD in physics (heat transfers & fluid mechanics) in 2021, in partnership with EDF, TOTAL and the LTEN in Nantes.

I was born in Bourges, in Central France. I lived for 20 years in a little city called Fussy. I spent time with my friends doing things I'm not allowed to share with you =) (but I can share that I particularly enjoyed this time)


Dancing is one of my passions. I love it! I have danced Bachata for almost 5 years now. Bachata is a latin dance from Dominican Republic, and is danced all over the world. I also play guitar and I love play Nothing Else Matters from Metallica.
